# üçÉ Tea Management System - Machine Learning Project

This project is a **Tea Management System** built using **Python** and **Machine Learning (Decision Tree Classifier)**.  
It analyzes product cost, selling price, profit, and quantity sold to provide **AI-based recommendations** for improving sales and profit margins.  
The project also automatically generates a **PowerPoint presentation** summarizing the analysis, decision tree, and visual results.

## üìä Features

‚úÖ Predicts the quantity of tea sold using a trained **Decision Tree Classifier**  
‚úÖ Analyzes relationships between **cost price, selling price, full quantity, and profit**  
‚úÖ Visualizes:
- Decision Tree structure  
- Feature importance chart  
- Product Type vs Quantity Sold graph  

‚úÖ Generates a **PowerPoint presentation (`Tea_Management_AI.pptx`)** containing:
- Dataset Overview  
- Decision Tree Visualization  
- Feature Importance  
- Product Type vs Quantity Sold  

‚úÖ Provides **AI-based recommendations** for each product:
- Low profit margin  
- Promote high-profit products  
- Suggests discounts for low sales  
- Advises on price increases for high demand
